Some interesting game concepts that will maybe make their way into some real project someday

## cards.py
An interesting system for turn based strategy minions. The same card can have different effects on differently configured
minions. The special moves of the minions work a little different and add an extra angle.

## picker.py
A picker to choose dialogue options with K_UP and K_DOWN
